# SC1015 Datascience Mini-project: Natural Disaster Occurrence Predictions
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on making predictions on the likelihood of natural disasters occuring based on the change in our climate.

## Models used
- Grid Search ARIMA hyperparameters
- Seasonal-ARIMAX (SARIMAX) 
- Multi-Variate Linear Regression

## Out-of-classroom implementations
- Initiating the use of Git-hub and Google Colab for project collaboration and data repository purposes
- Implementing different visualiztion tools such as world map, 
- Implementing and choosing a right forecasting models
- Implementing Multi-Variate linear regression model

## Challenges faced
- Greenhouse gases datasets have different starting year datapoints
- Temperature change datasets 
- Disasters datasets
